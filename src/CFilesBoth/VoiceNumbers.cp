/* About voice tables:
	A document's "voice-mapping table" or (for short) "voice table" says what internal
voice numbers are in use and, for each one that is in use: what part it belongs to;
its "voice position" or "role" (upper, lower, cross-staff, or single); and its
user voice number, by which Nightingale lets the user refer to the voice. Internal
voice numbers must be unique, but user voice numbers need not be--in fact, they start
with 1 for each part.

The voice table, doc->voiceTab, is indexed by the internal voice number. Every staff
has a default voice whose internal number is the same as its staff number, and we
reserve slots in the table for these voices. Thus, in a 5-staff score, the first 5
entries in the table always refer to the default voices. If the score consists of one
2-staff part and (below it) one 3-staff part, the beginning of the table looks like
this:
	slot (=internal voice)	1	2	3	4	5
	part							1	1	2	2	2
	user voice					1	2	1	2	3

Finally, the table must always be compact, i.e., there can be no slots in use after
the first empty slot. */
