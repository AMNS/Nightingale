/* These routines are tools for the rest of Nightingale to use to manipulate
the insertion caret.  Each Document has its own caret, which is either
active or inactive, usually in parallel with the Document.  When the caret
is inactive, it is always invisible.  When it is active, it is either
visible or invisible, depending on what part of its blink cycle it's in.
When the caret is visible, it is said to be ON; otherwise OFF. 

We show the caret in the usual way, by alternating the pixels at its location
between normal and inverted (black/white). Originally, we did something very
different, namely alternating the pixels between normal and all black; that
required much more machinery, as described in this comment: "When the caret
goes from OFF to ON, the background bits that are about to be covered are
saved. When it goes back OFF, they are restored.  Since only one caret should
be visible at a time (presumably in the frontmost Document), we can store the
background bits in one global place, which we can initialise regardless of
whether there are any documents open yet." Aside from its general complexity,
this "CopyBits" method crashed mysteriously on IIci's and fx's. Also, it's
not clear that it looks better than the usual way. So to hell with it. */
