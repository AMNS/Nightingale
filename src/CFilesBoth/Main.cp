 * 									May 1986-Sept. 1997
 *
 * Also incorporates OMS code by Ken Brockman, a very small amount of code by each of
 * Ray Spears and Jim Carr, and a help system by Joe Pillera.
 *
 *	Thanks to Bill Brinkley, Mike Brockman, Bill Buxton, John Davis, Ric Ford,
 *	John Gibson, David Gottlieb, Doug Hofstadter, Scott Kim, Jan Knoefel, Paul Lansky,
 *	Katharine McKenna, Malcolm and Priscilla McKenna, Scott McCormick, Jef Raskin, Steve
 * Sacco, Paul Sadowski, Kim Stickney, and Christopher Yavelow. Special thanks to John
 * Maxwell and Severo Ornstein, without whom I could not have imagined this program. And
 * very special thanks to my father, Eugene Byrd, and my wife, Susan Schneider, without
 * whom it certainly would never have been finished...
 *
 *	Nightingale is very loosely based on several earlier programs. The approach owes
 *	a great deal to John Maxwell and Severo Ornstein's Mockingbird; to the Macintosh
 * standard user interface and its implementation in various earlier programs; and, to
 *	a lesser extent, Donald Byrd's SMUT. A few of the algorithms are from SMUT, as doc-
 *	umented in Byrd's dissertation "Music Notation by Computer" (Indiana University,
 *	1984; UMI number 8506091).
