/* QuickScroll(doc,dx,dy,rel,doCopy) scrolls the view rectangle (the content of the
window associated with document doc, minus the scroll and grow icon areas)
by dx pixels horizontally, and dy pixels vertically.  It does this without 
creating update events, since it can be called from within ScrollDocument(),
which is called repeatedly from TrackControl(), and from AutoScroll.
If either of dx or dy are so large that the entire view would be
scrolled offscreen, it just erases and redraws; otherwise, it BitBlt's
the view rectangle the appropriate distance, and redraws only the newly
scrolled-in rectangle(s).  Essentially, it implements an update region
using the document's view rectangle.  If doCopy is FALSE, then we don't
muck with anything in the view rectangle, but do everything else.
This gets complicated by any floating palettes, since each one of them
brings in 1 or 2 more rectangular areas to be updated.  Whether we should
just go back to standard update regions or not depends on how the page-
redrawing routines are when given this increasing number of of rectangles. */
