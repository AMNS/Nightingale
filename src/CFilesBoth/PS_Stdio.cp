/* Here is a simpler, shorter version of printf for printing directly to the

self-sufficient library-wise and want to avoid loading someone else's sprintf().
But it also incorporates some non-standard features. According to ANSI/ISO,
"%p" is a pointer to void, and the result is the value of the pointer; PS_Print
assumes it's a pointer to a Pascal string, and the result is the string. Also,
PS_Print accepts "%P" as a variation on "%p" that generates escape codes for
non-standard PostScript characters (see PS_Char). If you need the stdio library
anyway, you could use sprintf to format strings and then call PS_String() to
print them, but you'd have to do something about PS_Print's non-standard features.
