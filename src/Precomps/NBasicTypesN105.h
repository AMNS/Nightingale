/*	NBasicTypesN105.h - #defines and typedefs for Nightingale's basic datatypes - version
for the 'N105' file format. NB: Many of these appear in Nightingale score files, so
changing them may be a problem for backward compatibility. In fact, in format 'N105'
files (as well as in-memory data structures of earlier versions of Nightingale), our
objects and subobjects as well as file headers are jammed with bit fields. In the words
of Harbison & Steele's _C: A Reference Manual_, bit fields are "likely to be nonportable".
Indeed, handling of bit fields in code generated by the C compiler in Xcode 2.5 for Intel
CPUs vs. PowerPCs is not compatible. Nightingale has always run on PowerPCs, so we need
to get bit fields out of files to let Nightingale on Intel read older files. */
