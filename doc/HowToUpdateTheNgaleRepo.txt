HOW TO UPDATE THE NIGHTINGALE GITHUB REPOSITORY FROM DON'S G5 DEVELOPMENT FOLDER
DAB, early May 2020

This ridiculous procedure is necessary mostly because OS 10.5.x -- the latest that a
G5 can run -- can no longer run a version of git compatible with GitHub.

1.	On the G5, compress NightingaleDABVer_5p9, copy the compressed version to the
	git machine (normally MacBook Air), and uncompress it there. Or (less desirable)
	just copy NightingaleDABVer_5p9 to the git machine, compress it there, and copy
	the compressed form back to the G5.

Everything from here on is on the git machine.

2.	If the documentation files in AMNSGenlDocs/NgalePorting+DevNotes aren't up-to-date,
	fix that. DetailedVersionHistory_2012ToPresent.txt changes very often, and
	NgaleDevelopmentLog.txt almost as often. Other documents of concern include
	HowToUpdateTheNgaleRepo.txt (this document), and tech notes. 
3.	Put an uncompressed copy in the NgaleDev folder; put the compressed form in
	AMNSGenlDocs.
4.	Rename the original folder as "N5p9_TO_REPO" or some such; in it, throw away
	the Resources folder (unless the .rsrc or something else has changed: a very rare
	occurrence)	and any obvious temp files/folders.
5.	In N5p9_TO_REPO, move build/Release/Nightingale.app to AMNSGenlDocs; throw away
	the rest of the build folder.
6.	Rename "Nightingale.app" to "NightingalePPC.app".
7.	Compress NightingalePPC.app, and move the compressed version to N5p9_TO_REPO. There
	should now be 11 items in N5p9_TO_REPO.
8.	Move everything from N5p9_TO_REPO to donbyrd/NightingaleGitRepo, replacing what's
	there.
9.	In NightingaleGitRepo, update the doc folder by replacing any files that have
	changed by copying them from AMNSGenlDocs/NgalePorting+DevNotes.
	DetailedVersionHistory_2012ToPresent.txt should always have changes. NgaleDevelopmentLog.txt
	is also likely to have changed. If any other docs (HowToUpdateTheNgaleRepo.txt
	(this document), tech notes, etc.) have changed, replace them too.
	
For the last steps, either use git directly or any of several frontends; I use SourceTree.

10. In NightingaleGitRepo, throw away any temporary files from the development process.
11. Commit changed files, and push to appropriate branch(es) of the GitHub repository.
