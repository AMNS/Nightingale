HOW TO UPDATE THE NIGHTINGALE GITHUB REPOSITORY FROM DON'S G5 DEVELOPMENT FOLDER
DAB, early February 2020

This ridiculous procedure is necessary mostly because OS 10.5.x -- the latest that a
G5 can run -- can no longer run a version of git compatible with GitHub.

1.	On the G5, compress NightingaleDABVer_5p9.
2.	Copy uncompressed (or copy, then uncompress) to the MacBook Air.
3.	Put a copy in the NgaleDev folder.
4.	Rename the original copy folder as "N5p9_TO_REPO" or some such; in it, throw away
	the Resources folder (unless the .rsrc or something else has changed: a very rare
	occurrence)	and any obvious temp files/folders.
5.	In N5p9_TO_REPO, throw away everything in the build folder except
	Release/Nightingale.app.
6.	Rename "Nightingale.app" to "NightingalePPC.app".
7.	Compress NightingalePPC.app, and move the compressed version to N5p9_TO_REPO.
8.	Move everything from N5p9_TO_REPO to donbyrd/NightingaleGitRepo, replacing what's there.
9.	In NightingaleGitRepo, update the doc folder by replacing the files NgaleDevelopmentLog.txt
	and DetailedVersionHistory_2012ToPresent.txt with the latest.
10. In NightingaleGitRepo, throw away any temporary files from the development process.
11. Commit changed files, and push to appropriate branch(es) of the GitHub repository.
