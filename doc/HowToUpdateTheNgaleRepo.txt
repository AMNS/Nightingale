HOW TO UPDATE THE NIGHTINGALE GITHUB REPOSITORY FROM DON'S G5 DEVELOPMENT FOLDER
DAB, mid February 2020

This ridiculous procedure is necessary mostly because OS 10.5.x -- the latest that a
G5 can run -- can no longer run a version of git compatible with GitHub.

1.	On the G5, compress NightingaleDABVer_5p9.
2.	Copy uncompressed to the MacBook Air, then compress (or copy, then uncompress).
3.	Put an uncompressed copy  in the NgaleDev folder; put the compressed form in
	AMNSGenlDocs.
4.	Rename the original copy folder as "N5p9_TO_REPO" or some such; in it, throw away
	the Resources folder (unless the .rsrc or something else has changed: a very rare
	occurrence)	and any obvious temp files/folders.
5.	In N5p9_TO_REPO, throw away everything in the build folder except
	Release/Nightingale.app.
6.	Rename "Nightingale.app" to "NightingalePPC.app".
7.	Compress NightingalePPC.app, and move the compressed version to N5p9_TO_REPO.
8.	Move everything from N5p9_TO_REPO to donbyrd/NightingaleGitRepo, replacing what's there.
9.	In NightingaleGitRepo, update the doc folder by replacing the files NgaleDevelopmentLog.txt,
	DetailedVersionHistory_2012ToPresent.txt, and HowToUpdateTheNgaleRepo.txt (this
	document) with the latest. If any other documents (tech notes, etc.) have changed,
	replace them too.
10. In NightingaleGitRepo, throw away any temporary files from the development process.
11. Commit changed files, and push to appropriate branch(es) of the GitHub repository.
