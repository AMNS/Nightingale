HOW TO UPDATE THE NIGHTINGALE GITHUB REPOSITORY FROM DON'S G5 DEVELOPMENT FOLDER
DAB, mid February 2021

This ridiculous procedure is necessary mostly because OS 10.5.x -- the latest that a G5 can
run -- can no longer run a version of git compatible with GitHub. Another factor is arguably
that I'm obsessive.

NB: If only docs have changed, not code, do only steps 2, 9, and 11.

1.	On the G5, compress NightingaleDABVer_5p9, copy the compressed version to the git
	machine (normally MacBook Air), and uncompress it there. Or (less desirable) just
	copy NightingaleDABVer_5p9 to the git machine, compress it there, and copy the
	compressed form back to the G5.

The following steps are on the git machine.

2.	If the documentation files in AMNSGenlDocs aren't up-to-date, correct that.
	DetailedVersionHistory_2012ToPresent.txt changes very often, and NgaleDevelopmentLog.txt
	almost as often. Other documents of concern include HowToUpdateTheNgaleRepo.txt (this
	document), and tech notes.
3.	Put an uncompressed copy of NightingaleDABVer_5p9 in the NgaleDev folder; put the
	compressed form in AMNSGenlDocs.
4.	Rename the original folder as "N5p9 TO REPO" or some such. If anything in the
	Resources folder has changed (a very rare occurrence), handle that. NB that git
	doesn't know about resource forks and doesn't store their contents (though though it
	saves the files with their data forks and proper names!), so if it's the .rsrc,
	compress it, and move the compressed file to N5p9 TO REPO. (The same is probably true
	of other files in Resources.) Throw away the Resources folder, as well as any obvious
	temp files/folders.
5.	In N5p9_TO_REPO, move build/Release/NightingalePPC.app and build/Release/NightingaleIntel.app
	to NgaleDev/Executables; throw away the rest of the build folder.
6.	Compress NightingalePPC.app and NightingaleIntel.app, and move the compressed versions
	to N5p9_TO_REPO. There should now be 12 (13 if .rsrc has changed so a new .rsrc.zip is
	needed) items in N5p9_TO_REPO.
7.	Move everything from N5p9_TO_REPO to donbyrd/NightingaleGitRepo, replacing what's there.
8.	In NightingaleGitRepo, update the doc folder by replacing any files that have changed
	by copying them from AMNSGenlDocs/NgalePorting+DevNotes.
	DetailedVersionHistory_2012ToPresent.txt should always have changes. NgaleDevelopmentLog.txt
	is also likely to have changed. If any other docs -- HowToUpdateTheNgaleRepo.txt (this
	document), tech notes, etc. -- have changed, replace them too.
	
For the next steps, either use git directly or any of several frontends; I use SourceTree.

9. In NightingaleGitRepo, throw away any temporary files from the development process.
10. Commit changed files, and push to appropriate branch(es) of the GitHub repository.

Finally, update things on the G5 to keep in sync.

11. Replace the copies of NightingalePPC.app and NightingaleIntel.app in the G5's
	NgaleDev/Executables.
12. Replace the compressed form of NightingaleDABVer_5p9 in the G5's AMNSGenlDocs.
