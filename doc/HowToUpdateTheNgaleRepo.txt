HOW TO UPDATE THE NIGHTINGALE GITHUB REPOSITORY FROM DON'S G5 DEVELOPMENT FOLDER
DAB, late March 2020

This ridiculous procedure is necessary mostly because OS 10.5.x -- the latest that a
G5 can run -- can no longer run a version of git compatible with GitHub.

1.	On the G5, compress NightingaleDABVer_5p9.
2.	Copy uncompressed to the MacBook Air, then compress (or copy, then uncompress).
3.	Put an uncompressed copy in the NgaleDev folder; put the compressed form in
	AMNSGenlDocs.
4.	Rename the original copy folder as "N5p9_TO_REPO" or some such; in it, throw away
	the Resources folder (unless the .rsrc or something else has changed: a very rare
	occurrence)	and any obvious temp files/folders.
5.	In N5p9_TO_REPO, throw away everything in the build folder except
	Release/Nightingale.app; move Nightingale.app to AMNSGenlDocs.
6.	Rename "Nightingale.app" to "NightingalePPC.app".
7.	Compress NightingalePPC.app, and move the compressed version to N5p9_TO_REPO. There
	should now be 11 items in N5p9_TO_REPO.
8.	Move everything from N5p9_TO_REPO to donbyrd/NightingaleGitRepo, replacing what's
	there.
9.	In NightingaleGitRepo, update the doc folder by replacing any files that have
	changed. DetailedVersionHistory_2012ToPresent.txt should always have changes.
	NgaleDevelopmentLog.txt is also likely to have changed. If any other documents
	(HowToUpdateTheNgaleRepo.txt (this document), tech notes, etc.) have changed,
	replace them too.
10. In NightingaleGitRepo, throw away any temporary files from the development process.
11. Commit changed files, and push to appropriate branch(es) of the GitHub repository.
