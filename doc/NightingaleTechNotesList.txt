NIGHTINGALE TECH NOTES - Don Byrd, rev. early January 2022

As compared to earlier versions of this list (through early 2016), I've added numbers to
several of the formerly unnumbered tech notes, and re-organized the full collection into
three categories: "User Oriented", "Mostly for Developers", and "Obsolete and/or of
Minimal Interest."

NB: These still need a lot of work. One (#2), the Coding Guidelines, is now in the
AMNS/Nightingale GitHub repository in a somewhat more up-to-date form. And very few are
really up-to-date.

Key to St (Status) codes:

OK: definitely OK
OK?: probably OK with only minor problems
Old: obsolescent and of little interest anymore (but worth keeping)
OBS: obsolete and probably of no interest anymore (but worth keeping just in case)
Rep: the current version is in the GitHub repository; the tech note version isn't up-to-date
