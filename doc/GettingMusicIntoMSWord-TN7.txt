Nightingale Technical Note #7, December 1998; rev. Feb. 2001
Don Byrd

To get music from Nightingale into Microsoft Word with high graphic quality:

1. In Nightingale, Save PostScript, in ESPF form.

2. In MS Word, use the Insert Picture (not Paste) command to put the EPSF into a
paragraph with single spacing.

3. Put any character in the music font _above_ the EPSF, and not hidden. This is
necessary to make sure Sonata is downloaded to the printer! Also, the character may
need to be on the same page as the music (or the first page containing music, if
there are several in the document): otherwise a mysterious PostScript error may
occur. This is not nearly as odious as it sounds--a single tiny character (dot is a
good choice) is enough. But it's a bit tricky because, with Sonata's huge ascender
and descender heights, even a very small character can affect line spacing. A dot in
Sonata 5 (say) generally does the trick without causing any problems other than a
"flyspeck".

4. To crop or scale the music, click to select it. Then:
	With recent versions of Word: use the appropriate tool in the toolbar to drag
		any of the handles.
	With Word 6: to CROP, shift-drag a handle; to SCALE, drag without shift(?).
	With Word 5.x for Mac: to CROP, drag either center handle; to SCALE, shift-drag. 

Tip: for small examples, consider using the standard Nightingale templates
(ShortExamplesTemplate1 thru ShortExamplesTemplate4).

Note: the comment about getting Sonata downloaded to the printer apparently applies
also to Quark, and probably also to other programs. In Quark, at least, making the
music-font character white both does the job and avoids defacing the page.
