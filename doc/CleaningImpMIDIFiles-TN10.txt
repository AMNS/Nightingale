Cleaning Up MIDI files Imported Into Nightingale
Nightingale Technical Note #10
Don Byrd, June 2001; minor rev., March 2012

The following procedure is very rough: there's too much variation from situation
to situation for it to be otherwise. You may want to Save at almost any step,
just in case.

RC = specific to Bach "raw chorales".

- (optional) In Master Page: Change staff size.
- (optional) Select All, Respace (typically to 80-90%), and Reformat.
- Scan for nonsense chords created by too-coarse quantization.
- (RC) Remove notes/rests on top 2 staves.
- In Master Page: remove any staves with no notes/rests. With RC, at this
	point, the top 2 staves; with some MIDI files from Classical MIDI
	Archive, the bottom 2 or more staves.
- (optional) In Master Page: Group staves appropriately.
- (optional) In Master Page: Change staff size.
- Select All, Reformat.
- Handle clef changes:
	- Move any in the middle of tied notes/chords to left or right.
	- Remove any nonsensical ones.
- Handle key signature and accidentals:
	- Add appropriate key signatures.
	- (optional) Select All; Respell once or twice (depending on whether
		it's a sharp or a flat key). (The second Respell is necessary for
		flat keys because Nightingale's defaults to sharps if there's no
		key signature.)
	- Check for incorrect spelling, and Respell or (e.g., for E-sharp
		notated as F-natural) otherwise correct as needed.
	- Select All; Delete Redundant Accs.
- Select All, Beam by Beat.
- Select All, Respace (typically to 80-90%), and Reformat.
- Save.
- With beta copies (optional): Close, Open, Debug Check.
