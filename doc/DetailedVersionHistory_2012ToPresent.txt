NIGHTINGALE CHANGES (in DAB's current version), AFTER JUNE 2012 THRU JAN. 2016

(Most of the files in my Nightingale Carbon code base have last modification dates of
April or May 2012; a few files are 2 June 2012, and it looks like that's the last source
code I share with David G. This document describes all changes to my own code base since
then, the earliest of which are dated 4 March 2013.)


March 2013 - ??

* CoreMidiUtils.cp: make DebugPrintf output more readable.
* Removed messages in log output for every note (or Sync?) played, e.g.:
      pL=1461: rect.l=288,r=294 paper.l=-20860,r=-20248
	The huge number of those messages overwhelmed everything else in the log. Affects
	MIDIPlay.cp: #define PLDEBUG as 0.
* Fixed a horrible and very confusing kludge for turning notehead graphs off and on that
	resulted in measures often being respaced far too widely when Show Duration Problems
	was on. Added #define for NOTEHEAD_GRAPH_WIDTH; made doNoteheadGraphs a global.
	Affects defs.h, vars.h, DrawNRGR, InitNightingale, SpaceTime.
* Initialize.cp: display all CNFG field values & errors detected in them in log file;
	if config.whichMIDI is illegal, set it to a legal value (like all other fields).
* SpaceHighLevel.cp: improve debug print output for respacing.
* Added "Set tempo to visible/invisible" to QuickChange. Affects Set.h, SetCommand.cp,
	Nightingale.rsrc.
* Increased the minimum legal value of config.lineLW from 1 to 5.
* Fixed bug: In the declaration of the Configuration struct, the _noteScanEpsXD_ field
	had somehow been deleted, resulting in misalignment of fields read in, nonsensical
	complaints about illegal CNFG values, ledger lines too long, etc. Affects
	applicationTypes.h .
* Debug output for playback is excessive; disable some. Affects MIDIPlay.cp: #define
	CMDEBUG as 0.
* Remove code to check expiration date. Affects InitNightingale.cp .

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

March-June 2013

* Change max. tempo from 600 to 1200 BPM. Affects defs.h

* Print status of reading Prefs file, checking CNFG, etc. Affects Initialize.cp

* Advance expiration date by a year. Affects InitNightingale.cp

* Don't print info on every Sync as it's played. Affects MIDIPlay.cp

* Display values of all CNFG fields in log; if any are bad, list all bad ones in error
message. Affects Initialize.cp

* Fix "Respace sometimes leaves way too much space, especially after a dotted
note/chord" bug. Affects vars.h; DrawNRGR.c, InitNightingale.c, SpaceTime.c: add global
<doNoteheadGraphs> to say whether to display noteheads as tiny graphs; defs.h:
declaration of <NOTEHEAD_GRAPH_WIDTH>.

* Minor cleanup. Affects SpaceHighLevel.c; DrawUtils.cp: DrawMChar: removed #if'd-out
code

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

mid-Aug. - Nov. 2013

* Add to QuickChange "Set tempo M.M. visibility to visible/invisible". Affects .rsrc:
add "M.M. visibility" to Tempo popup; SetUtils.c: add SetSelTempoVisible; SetCommand.c:
improve description of how to add features; various.

* DrawObject.cp: comment out DebugPrintf(s).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

23 Mar.- 5 Apr. 2015

* Get rid of the nonsensical statement about duration problems Score Info always gives
following its correct statement about duration problems. Affects ScoreInfo.c:
ScoreInfo(): remove two redundant lines of code just before call to HasMidiMap().

* Changes to Nightingale.rsrc:
	* Change "Midi" to "MIDI" in the "Midi Map" menu command, the MIDI Map dialog, and
		several error messages
	* Reduce size of the "MIDI Modifier Effects" dialog
	* Reduce size of the "Change Dynamic To" dialog
	* Remove phony politeness -- the word "Please" -- from various dialogs

* Increase max. play duration allowed in Set Duration dialog from 300% to 500%, mostly
to handle better the "logical 8th note with half-note head" situation (as in Brahms
piano music). NB: This doesn't help if the situation is "logical duration shorter than
8th note with half-note head", but that seems to be much less common. Affects .rsrc:
STR# 240; DialogsEditor.cp.

* Fix bug in Debug output: Debug Check incorrectly complains about (most? all?)
initial Keysigs of systems with no sharps/flats that their objRects are "GARBAGE
(UNSELECTABLE)". Affects DebugUtils.c: DCheckNode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11 May - 14 June 2015

* Add a "Relative Playback Speed..." command to the Play/Rec menu: it sets playback
tempi to a percentage of the "correct" (marked) tempos. Make its keyboard shortcut
command-8. (All letters and all other digits are already taken.) Set the shortcut for
Instrument MIDI Settings back to option-command-M. Affects .rsrc: STR# 240;
NightTemplates.h, NResourceID.h, vars.h, InitNightingale, Menu, MIDIDialogs, MIDIPlay.

* Change the default type for Save PostScript from "EPSF for one page" to "PostScript
text for entire file". Affects CarbonPrinting.cp .

* Change two error messages saying a problem is "probably" because of insufficient
memory to "perhaps" because of insufficient memory. Affects .rsrc: STR# 228.

* Fix bug: the channel and patch number in the Instrument settings dialog (from Master
Page) is initialized with illegal values instead of the instrument's current channel and
patch number. Affects InstrDialog.cp: InstrDialog().

* Add error check for patch no. in the Instrument settings dialog. Affects
InstrDialog.cp: InstrDialog().

* Correct wording of an error message from the Instrument settings dialog. Affects
.rsrc: STR# 265.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22 July - 12 August

Increase the default window width, which is ridiculously narrow on a typical modern
display. Affects .rsrc: in WIND 2000, change 620 to 690. (This is still pretty narrow,
but just right for one letter-size page at 100% magnification; if the window is any
wider, it'll show a fraction of a second page, screwing up auto page turning on
playback.)

Do debug printing for the Import MIDI File command if the shift & control keys are down;
minor cleanup. Affects MIDIFOpen.cp.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

30 August - 9 Sept.

Decrease the height of the "Change modifier" and "Add this modifier..." dialogs;
change wording of the latter from "notes" to "notes/rests". Affects .rsrc.

Change keyboard shortcut for Relative Playback Speed from command-8 (which was already
taken by Create Octave Sign!) to shift-command-0; make its dialog slightly wider; make
the MIDI Modifier Effects dialog slightly smaller. Affects .rsrc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12 - 16 Sept.

Fix bug in MIDI file export where tempo changes after the first few are often ignored.
Affects MIDIPlay.cp: PlaySequence().

MIDIPlay.cp: Change most instances of "Midi" in function names to "MIDI"; improve
comments; minor cleanup.

MIDIFOpen.cp: In Debug prints for TEMPO metaevents, add "(TEMPO)"; rename the two
versions of GetRelObj (with different calling sequences: this assumes a C++ compiler,
a bad idea) to GetTempoRelObj and GetCtrlRelObj; clean up code.

MIDIFSave.cp: Clarify DebugPrintf's; warn (via DebugPrintf) if tempo change is at the
same time as a previous tempo change; minor cleanup.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17 - 30 Sept.

Add an "Expanded" option to the text entry and Define Text Styles dialogs. Affects
.rsrc; defs.h; DrawObject, StringUtils, TextDialog.

StringToolbox.cp: minor cleanup.

MIDIPlay.cp: Change more instances of "Midi" in function names to "MIDI".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 - 4 October

Integrate my codebase with the codebase in the AMNS/Nightingale GitHub repository, which
dates from late June 2012. Integrated ca. 7 .h's and 19 .cp's, but -- as a result of
Geoff's large-scale cruft removal in 2012 -- almost all files changed.

Update/simplify About box. Affects About.cp, .rsrc: DLOG 451.

Change version number from 5.4 to 5.5! Affects Info.plist.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

27 Sept. - 18 Oct.

Add a "Mute Part" command to the Play/Rec menu; notes for the muted part will neither
be played nor written to an exported MIDI file. Affects .rsrc; applicationTypes.h,
MIDIGeneral.h, NightTemplates.h, NResourceID.h; Documents, Menu, MIDIDialogs, MIDIPlay,
MIDIFSave, MIDIUtils, Part.

In code to display config fields: add _musicFontID_; rearrange to come closer to the
order of declarations; minor cleanup. Affects applicationTypes.h; Initialize.

PS_Stdio: clarify comments; minor cleanup.

Make Debug Check's checking for "SYSTEM AT xxx RECT PAST RIGHT MARGIN" less strict.
Affects DebugUtils.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20 - 26 Oct.

Add to the config fields displayed _fastScreenSlurs_ & _enclWidthOffset_; clarify
comments; minor cleanup. Affects Initialize.

Clarify a comment. Affects DebugUtils.

Tweak the Info dialog for notes/rests and the one for most other symbols (DLOGs 596 and
598) to make them more readable. Affects .rsrc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

27-28 Oct.			====== NIGHTINGALE 5.5 ======

Fix bug: ExpandString() doesn't check for excessively long strings correctly. Affects
StringUtils.

Make the "expanded" option for regular text strings independent of the style instead of
part of the style definition; minor cleanup. Affects .rsrc; Browser, Check, DrawObject,
Insert, InsNew, InsNew.h, MIDIFOpen, NightTemplates.h, NTypes.h, TextDialog. NB: This
option is not entirely backwards compatible: some text in some old scores now comes out
(incorrectly) as "expanded" -- I don't know why.

Add an "expanded" option for text in tempo marks; minor cleanup. Affects .rsrc; Browser,
Check, DialogsEditor, DrawObject, Insert, InsNew, InsNew.h, MIDIFOpen, NightTemplates.h,
NTypes.h.

===============================================================================

3-16 Nov.

Further tweak the Info dialog for notes/rests and the one for most other symbols (DLOGs
596 and 598) to make them more readable. Affects .rsrc; InfoDialog.

Clarify Browser display of the voice table. Affects Browser.

Preliminary work towards letting user say "when respacing, ignore the chord this note
belongs to". Affects .rsrc; Browser, InfoDialog, Objects, SpaceHighLevel, SpaceTime,
VoiceNumbers, NightTemplates.h, NTypes.h, vars.h.

Browser, InfoDialog, SpaceHighLevel, SpaceTime, VoiceNumbers, NTypes.h, vars.h: minor
cleanup.

Fix bug: when values are changed in many fields of the Sync Info and General Info
dialogs (DLOGs 596 and 598), the chars. for the new values are truncated because they
extend slightly below the boxes they're shown in. Affects .rsrc .

Tweak the Extended Info dialog (used for text strings, octave signs, and tuplets) to
make it more reaable. Affects .rsrc.

Display the tempo in effect in the Context window. Affects .rsrc; Browser.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17-26 Nov.

Add staff no. to the Debug messages about note or grace note in another part's voice.
Affects Debug2Utils.

Remove useless #ifdef's; minor cleanup. Affects MIDIPlay, Debug.h, NTypes.h.

Fix bug: in the Sync Info dialog and the General Info dialog (used for measures/barlines
and text) some labels are truncated into unclarity; in Sync Info, the value of the Onset
Time is truncated into incorrectness. Affects .rsrc.

Make the Context window interpret dynamic level -- e.g., it now shows "3 (pp)", not
just "3". Affects Browser.

In error conditions, explain via DebugPrintf; minor cleanup. Affects Browser.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

28 Nov.

CarbonPrinting: minor cleanup.

Clarify error message for attempt to zoom in further than the Screen Page Layout
allows. Affects .rsrc .

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

29 Nov. - 28 Dec.

Replace calls to DebugPrintf() -- which was simply #define'd as printf -- with calls to
a new function LogPrintf(), which uses syslog(Section 3) so messages go to the system
log and (optionally, via compile time option) also to stderr (which appears in Xcode's
Run Log window if Nightingale is running inside Xcode). Affects DebugUtils.h; about 60
files.

In the project file, put precomp headers in proper alphabetical order.

Minor cleanup. Affects many files.

Make the Browser window interpret dynamic level for Dynamics and Measures-- e.g., it
now shows "3 (pp)", not just "3". Affects Browser.

On MIDI playback, if multiple notes are simultaneously playing the same note number on
the same channel but end at different times, either hold the note till the last one ends
or (via compile-time option) stop playing that note when the first one ends, as Ngale
has always done. Affects MIDIUtils; MIDIGeneral.h.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

28-31 Dec.

Add control (via compile time option) of whether Nightingale complains about unisons
(whether perfect or augmented) in a chord, (1) when an attempt to create one is made
and (2) in Debug command output. Affects vars.h; Debug2Utils, InitNightingale, InsNew.

Minor cleanup; improve error checking slightly. Affects .rsrc; Context, Initialize,
MIDIPlay, Objects.

Fix bug: Double Selection often fails to update context in following objects correctly.
Affects Double.

Have Debug skip error messages for inconsistent links in beams if rests are present.

Remove unused parameter to EFixContForDynamic(). Affects Context.h; Context, Double,
MergeUtils, MoveUpDown.

Update version number in About box to 5.6b1. Affects info.plist .

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 - 10 Jan. 2016

Change the name of the Preferences file to "Nightingale AMNF Prefs". Affects .rsrc;
VersionStrings.h; Initialize.

Fix bug: the MIDI driver code in the default CNFG resource (used when creating a new
"Nightingale AMNF Prefs" file) is illegal. Affects .rsrc .

In Browser, improve display of the voice-mapping table. Affects Browser.

Add hack code to swap staves in an existing score; it doesn't work for the intended
purpose and it's #ifdef'd out, but it might be useful with a simpler score.

Make Debug stop complaining about the first Sync of a measure in the clipboard not
being at time zero for the measure; make it stop complaining about valid bboxes of
final measures of right-justified systems. Affects DebugDisplay, DebugUtils.

Minor cleanup. Affects defs.h; Browser, DebugDisplay, DebugUtils, DrawObject, File,
Initialize, SpaceHighLevel, VoiceNumbers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11-14 Jan.			=== NIGHTINGALE 5.6b1 ===

Convert files encoded in Mac OS Roman to UTF-8; replace "sustain on" char. in code
with 0xA1 (its codepoint in Sonata). Affects DrawObject, Menu, DebugUtils.

Convert file with CRLF line endings to Unix. Affects defs.h.

Add a _friendly_ parameter to NameGraphicType() as in NameHeapType() & replace
inline code in BrowseGraphic() with a call to NameGraphicType. Affects Browser,
InfoDialog, UIFUtils.

Minor cleanup. Affects Browser, Double, InfoDialog, UIFUtils.

===============================================================================

18 - 31 Jan.

Change some default CNFG & other settings: "Default staff rastral size" (1) from 1
to 5; "Screen layout..." from vertical to horizontal; in MIDI Modifier values, increase
velocity offset for normal accent (>) from 30 to 40. Affects .rsrc.

Update version number in About box to 5.6b2. Affects info.plist .

Rename VoiceNumbers.cp to VoiceTable.cp.

Alphabetize precomp headers in the Xcode project.

When a (non-hairpin) dynamic is double-clicked, hilight its attachment point, as with
text graphics and tempo marks. Affects Check.c.

For tremolo slashes, reduce the slope considerably and the width slightly. Affects
DrawNRGR.

Make the "Can't find Prefs file: creating a new one" message stay on the screen longer.
Affects Initialize.

Clarify comments; minor (in Initialize, not so minor) cleanup. Affects defs.h, Check.c,
DrawNRGR, Initialize, UIFUtils.
