NIGHTINGALE CHANGES (in DAB's current version and GitHub repository)
March 2013 to Present

Most of the files in my Nightingale Carbon code base have last modification dates of
April or May 2012; a few files are 2 June 2012, and it looks like that's the last source
code I share with David Gottlieb's AMNS version. This document describes all changes to
the AMNF code base since then, the earliest of which are dated 4 March 2013.  --DAB


March 2013 - ??

* CoreMidiUtils.cp: make DebugPrintf output more readable.
* Removed messages in log output for every note (or Sync?) played, e.g.:
      pL=1461: rect.l=288,r=294 paper.l=-20860,r=-20248
	The huge number of those messages overwhelmed everything else in the log. Affects
	MIDIPlay.cp: #define PLDEBUG as 0.
* Fixed a horrible and very confusing kludge for turning notehead graphs off and on that
	resulted in measures often being respaced far too widely when Show Duration Problems
	was on. Added #define for NOTEHEAD_GRAPH_WIDTH; made doNoteheadGraphs a global.
	Affects defs.h, vars.h, DrawNRGR, InitNightingale, SpaceTime.
* Initialize.cp: display most CNFG field values & all errors detected in them in log
	file; if config.whichMIDI is illegal, set it to a legal value (like most other
	fields).
* SpaceHighLevel.cp: improve debug print output for respacing.
* Increased the minimum legal value of config.lineLW from 1 to 5.
* Fixed bug: In the declaration of the Configuration struct, the _noteScanEpsXD_ field
	had somehow been deleted, resulting in misalignment of fields read in, nonsensical
	complaints about illegal CNFG values, ledger lines too long, etc. Affects
	applicationTypes.h .
* Debug output for playback is excessive; disable some. Affects MIDIPlay.cp: #define
	CMDEBUG as 0.
* Remove code to check expiration date. Affects InitNightingale.cp .

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

March-June 2013

* Change max. tempo from 600 to 1200 BPM. Affects defs.h

* Print status of reading Prefs file, checking CNFG, etc. Affects Initialize.cp

* Advance expiration date by a year. Affects InitNightingale.cp

* Don't print info on every Sync as it's played. Affects MIDIPlay.cp

* Display values of all CNFG fields in log; if any are bad, list all bad ones in error
message. Affects Initialize.cp

* Fix "Respace sometimes leaves way too much space, especially after a dotted
note/chord" bug. Affects vars.h; DrawNRGR.c, InitNightingale.c, SpaceTime.c: add global
<doNoteheadGraphs> to say whether to display noteheads as tiny graphs; defs.h:
declaration of <NOTEHEAD_GRAPH_WIDTH>.

* Minor cleanup. Affects SpaceHighLevel.c; DrawUtils.cp: DrawMChar: removed #if'd-out
code

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

mid-Aug. - Nov. 2013

* Add to QuickChange "Set tempo M.M. visibility to visible/invisible". Affects .rsrc:
add "M.M. visibility" to Tempo popup; SetUtils.c: add SetSelTempoVisible; SetCommand.c:
improve description of how to add features; various.

* DrawObject.cp: comment out DebugPrintf(s).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

23 Mar.- 5 Apr. 2015

* Get rid of the nonsensical statement about duration problems Score Info always gives
following its correct statement about duration problems. Affects ScoreInfo.c:
ScoreInfo(): remove two redundant lines of code just before call to HasMidiMap().

* Changes to Nightingale.rsrc:
	* Change "Midi" to "MIDI" in the "Midi Map" menu command, the MIDI Map dialog, and
		several error messages
	* Reduce size of the "MIDI Modifier Effects" dialog
	* Reduce size of the "Change Dynamic To" dialog
	* Remove phony politeness -- the word "Please" -- from various dialogs

* Increase max. play duration allowed in Set Duration dialog from 300% to 500%, mostly
to handle better the "logical 8th note with half-note head" situation (as in Brahms
piano music). NB: This doesn't help if the situation is "logical duration shorter than
8th note with half-note head", but that seems to be much less common. Affects .rsrc:
STR# 240; DialogsEditor.cp.

* Fix bug in Debug output: Debug Check incorrectly complains about (most? all?)
initial Keysigs of systems with no sharps/flats that their objRects are "GARBAGE
(UNSELECTABLE)". Affects DebugUtils.c: DCheckNode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11 May - 14 June 2015

* Add a "Relative Playback Speed..." command to the Play/Rec menu: it sets playback
tempi to a percentage of the "correct" (marked) tempos. Make its keyboard shortcut
command-8. (All letters and all other digits are already taken.) Set the shortcut for
Instrument MIDI Settings back to option-command-M. Affects .rsrc: STR# 240;
NightTemplates.h, NResourceID.h, vars.h, InitNightingale, Menu, MIDIDialogs, MIDIPlay.

* Change the default type for Save PostScript from "EPSF for one page" to "PostScript
text for entire file". Affects CarbonPrinting.cp .

* Change two error messages saying a problem is "probably" because of insufficient
memory to "perhaps" because of insufficient memory. Affects .rsrc: STR# 228.

* Fix bug: the channel and patch number in the Instrument settings dialog (from Master
Page) is initialized with illegal values instead of the instrument's current channel and
patch number. Affects InstrDialog.cp: InstrDialog().

* Add error check for patch no. in the Instrument settings dialog. Affects
InstrDialog.cp: InstrDialog().

* Correct wording of an error message from the Instrument settings dialog. Affects
.rsrc: STR# 265.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22 July - 12 August

Increase the default window width, which is ridiculously narrow on a typical modern
display. Affects .rsrc: in WIND 2000, change 620 to 690. (This is still pretty narrow,
but just right for one letter-size page at 100% magnification; if the window is any
wider, it'll show a fraction of a second page, screwing up automatic page turning on
playback.)

Do debug printing for the Import MIDI File command if the shift & control keys are down;
minor cleanup. Affects MIDIFOpen.cp.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

30 August - 9 Sept.

Decrease the height of the "Change modifier" and "Add this modifier..." dialogs;
change wording of the latter from "notes" to "notes/rests". Affects .rsrc.

Change keyboard shortcut for Relative Playback Speed from command-8 (which was already
taken by Create Octave Sign!) to shift-command-0; make its dialog slightly wider; make
the MIDI Modifier Effects dialog slightly smaller. Affects .rsrc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12 - 16 Sept.

Fix bug in MIDI file export where tempo changes after the first few are often ignored.
Affects MIDIPlay.cp: PlaySequence().

MIDIPlay.cp: Change most instances of "Midi" in function names to "MIDI"; improve
comments; minor cleanup.

MIDIFOpen.cp: In Debug prints for TEMPO metaevents, add "(TEMPO)"; rename the two
versions of GetRelObj (with different calling sequences: this assumes a C++ compiler,
a bad idea) to GetTempoRelObj and GetCtrlRelObj; clean up code.

MIDIFSave.cp: Clarify DebugPrintf's; warn (via DebugPrintf) if tempo change is at the
same time as a previous tempo change; minor cleanup.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17 - 30 Sept.

Add an "Expanded" option to the text entry and Define Text Styles dialogs. Affects
.rsrc; defs.h; DrawObject, StringUtils, TextDialog.

StringToolbox.cp: minor cleanup.

MIDIPlay.cp: Change more instances of "Midi" in function names to "MIDI".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 - 4 October

Integrate my codebase with the codebase in the AMNS/Nightingale GitHub repository, which
dates from late June 2012. Integrated ca. 7 .h's and 19 .cp's, but -- as a result of
Geoff's large-scale cruft removal in 2012 -- almost all files changed.

Update/simplify About box. Affects About.cp, .rsrc: DLOG 451.

Change version number from 5.4 to 5.5! Affects Info.plist.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

27 Sept. - 18 Oct.

Add a "Mute Part" command to the Play/Rec menu; notes for the muted part will neither
be played nor written to an exported MIDI file. Affects .rsrc; applicationTypes.h,
MIDIGeneral.h, NightTemplates.h, NResourceID.h; Documents, Menu, MIDIDialogs, MIDIPlay,
MIDIFSave, MIDIUtils, Part.

In code to display config fields: add _musicFontID_; rearrange to come closer to the
order of declarations; minor cleanup. Affects applicationTypes.h; Initialize.

PS_Stdio: clarify comments; minor cleanup.

Make Debug Check's checking for "SYSTEM AT xxx RECT PAST RIGHT MARGIN" less strict.
Affects DebugUtils.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20 - 26 Oct.

Add to the config fields displayed _fastScreenSlurs_ & _enclWidthOffset_; clarify
comments; minor cleanup. Affects Initialize.

Clarify a comment. Affects DebugUtils.

Tweak the Info dialog for notes/rests and the one for most other symbols (DLOGs 596 and
598) to make them more readable. Affects .rsrc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

27-28 Oct.			======== NIGHTINGALE 5.5 (28 Oct. 2015) ========

Fix bug: ExpandString() doesn't check for excessively long strings correctly. Affects
StringUtils.

Make the "expanded" option for regular text strings independent of the style instead of
part of the style definition; minor cleanup. Affects .rsrc; Browser, Check, DrawObject,
Insert, InsNew, InsNew.h, MIDIFOpen, NightTemplates.h, NTypes.h, TextDialog. NB: This
option is not entirely backwards compatible: some text in some old scores now comes out
(incorrectly) as "expanded" -- I don't know why.

Add an "expanded" option for text in tempo marks; minor cleanup. Affects .rsrc; Browser,
Check, DialogsEditor, DrawObject, Insert, InsNew, InsNew.h, MIDIFOpen, NightTemplates.h,
NTypes.h.


=======================================================================================


3-16 Nov.

Further tweak the Info dialog for notes/rests and the one for most other symbols (DLOGs
596 and 598) to make them more readable. Affects .rsrc; InfoDialog.

Clarify Browser display of the voice table. Affects Browser.

Preliminary work towards letting user say "when respacing, ignore the chord this note
belongs to". Affects .rsrc; Browser, InfoDialog, Objects, SpaceHighLevel, SpaceTime,
VoiceNumbers, NightTemplates.h, NTypes.h, vars.h.

Browser, InfoDialog, SpaceHighLevel, SpaceTime, VoiceNumbers, NTypes.h, vars.h: minor
cleanup.

Fix bug: when values are changed in many fields of the Sync Info and General Info
dialogs (DLOGs 596 and 598), the chars. for the new values are truncated because they
extend slightly below the boxes they're shown in. Affects .rsrc .

Tweak the Extended Info dialog (used for text strings, octave signs, and tuplets) to
make it more reaable. Affects .rsrc.

Display the tempo in effect in the Context window. Affects .rsrc; Browser.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17-26 Nov.

Add staff no. to the Debug messages about note or grace note in another part's voice.
Affects Debug2Utils.

Remove useless #ifdef's; minor cleanup. Affects MIDIPlay, Debug.h, NTypes.h.

Fix bug: in the Sync Info dialog and the General Info dialog (used for measures/barlines
and text) some labels are truncated into unclarity; in Sync Info, the value of the Onset
Time is truncated into incorrectness. Affects .rsrc.

Make the Context window interpret dynamic level -- e.g., it now shows "3 (pp)", not
just "3". Affects Browser.

In error conditions, explain via DebugPrintf; minor cleanup. Affects Browser.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

28 Nov.

CarbonPrinting: minor cleanup.

Clarify error message for attempt to zoom in further than the Screen Page Layout
allows. Affects .rsrc .

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

29 Nov. - 28 Dec.

Replace calls to DebugPrintf() -- which was simply #define'd as printf -- with calls to
a new function LogPrintf(), which uses syslog(Section 3) so messages go to the system
log and (optionally, via compile time option) also to stderr (which appears in Xcode's
Run Log window if Nightingale is running inside Xcode). Affects DebugUtils.h; about 60
files.

In the project file, put precomp headers in proper alphabetical order.

Minor cleanup. Affects many files.

Make the Browser window interpret dynamic level for Dynamics and Measures-- e.g., it
now shows "3 (pp)", not just "3". Affects Browser.

On MIDI playback, if multiple notes are simultaneously playing the same note number on
the same channel but end at different times, either hold the note till the last one ends
or (via compile-time option) stop playing that note when the first one ends, as Ngale
has always done. Affects MIDIUtils; MIDIGeneral.h.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

28-31 Dec.

Add control (via compile time option) of whether Nightingale complains about unisons
(whether perfect or augmented) in a chord, (1) when an attempt to create one is made
and (2) in Debug command output. Affects vars.h; Debug2Utils, InitNightingale, InsNew.

Minor cleanup; improve error checking slightly. Affects .rsrc; Context, Initialize,
MIDIPlay, Objects.

Fix bug: Double Selection often fails to update context in following objects correctly.
Affects Double.

Have Debug skip error messages for inconsistent links in beams if rests are present.

Remove unused parameter to EFixContForDynamic(). Affects Context.h; Context, Double,
MergeUtils, MoveUpDown.

Update version number in About box to 5.6b1. Affects info.plist .

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 - 10 Jan. 2016

Change the name of the Preferences file to "Nightingale AMNF Prefs". Affects .rsrc;
VersionStrings.h; Initialize.

Fix bug: the MIDI driver code in the default CNFG resource (used when creating a new
"Nightingale AMNF Prefs" file) is illegal. Affects .rsrc .

In Browser, improve display of the voice-mapping table. Affects Browser.

Add hack code to swap staves in an existing score; it doesn't work for the intended
purpose and it's #ifdef'd out, but it might be useful with a simpler score.

Make Debug stop complaining about the first Sync of a measure in the clipboard not
being at time zero for the measure; make it stop complaining about valid bboxes of
final measures of right-justified systems. Affects DebugDisplay, DebugUtils.

Minor cleanup. Affects defs.h; Browser, DebugDisplay, DebugUtils, DrawObject, File,
Initialize, SpaceHighLevel, VoiceNumbers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11-14 Jan.			==== NIGHTINGALE 5.6b1 ====

Convert files encoded in Mac OS Roman to UTF-8; replace "sustain on" char. in code
with 0xA1 (its codepoint in Sonata). Affects DrawObject, Menu, DebugUtils.

Convert file with CRLF line endings to Unix. Affects defs.h.

Add a _friendly_ parameter to NameGraphicType() as in NameHeapType() & replace
inline code in BrowseGraphic() with a call to NameGraphicType. Affects Browser,
InfoDialog, UIFUtils.

Minor cleanup. Affects Browser, Double, InfoDialog, UIFUtils.

===============================================================================

18 - 3 Feb.

Change some default CNFG & other settings: "Default staff rastral size" (1) from 1
to 5; "Screen layout..." from vertical to horizontal; in MIDI Modifier values, increase
velocity offset for normal accent (>) from 30 to 40. Affects .rsrc.

Update version number in About box to 5.6b2. Affects info.plist .

Rename VoiceNumbers.cp to VoiceTable.cp.

Alphabetize precomp headers in the Xcode project.

When a (non-hairpin) dynamic is double-clicked, hilight its attachment point, as with
text graphics and tempo marks. Affects Check.c.

For tremolo slashes, reduce the slope considerably and the width slightly. Affects
DrawNRGR.

Make the "Can't find Prefs file: creating a new one" message stay on the screen longer.
Affects Initialize.

Clarify comments; minor (but in Initialize, not so minor!) cleanup. Affects defs.h,
Check.c, DrawNRGR, Initialize, UIFUtils.

Update long version no. to 5.6. Affects info.plist.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

===============================================================================

9-17 Feb.

Improve Debug output format for readability; minor cleanup. Affects DebugDisplay.

around the notes' stems. Affects DrawNRGR.

Minor cleanup. Affects DebugDisplay, DrawHighLvel, DrawNRGR, DrawObject.

Change version no. to 5.6b3. Affects .rsrc, Info.plist.

Display four more CNFG field values in log. Affects Initialize.

Add units to _tempoMarkHGap_ in the CNFG Resorcerer template. Affects .rsrc.

Rename SPACE objects to SPACER. Affects MemMacros.h, NTypes.h, vars.h, and
about 40 C files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

25-26 Feb.			==== NIGHTINGALE 5.6b3 ====

Add to Debug Check a check for Measures of zero width that nonetheless contain
something. Affects DebugUtils.

===============================================================================

27-29 Feb.

Change the name of the OCTAVA object to OTTAVA; change comments, identifiers, etc.
accordingly. Affects about 70 files.

Update version number in About box to 5.6b4. Affects info.plist .

Restore mysteriously lost code changes; minor changes. Affects DebugUtils.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2-7 Mar.

Improve feedback on screen font availability; minor cleanup. Affects InitNightinale.

Make the Browser & Context commands show clef type as string as well as code. Affects
Browser.

Fix bug: On PostScript output, piano pedal up and down symbols are unintelligible
because they're not drawn in a music font.

Add code to LogPrintf() to make it raise the level of messages below a given threshhold
before calling syslog(); this is to work around the odd fact that on my G5, messages
below LOG_NOTICE never go into the log, regardless of setlogmask(().

Make the Empty Measures command set its default measure range from the selection.
Affects Menu.

Minor cleanup. Affects DrawObject, MeasFill, Menu.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8-11 Mar.			       ==== NIGHTINGALE 5.6b4 ====

The Score Info dialog is larger, and it now reports how many empty measures the score
contains and the measure no. of the first. Affects NightTemplates.h, MeasFill,
ScoreInfo; .rsrc: enlarge DLOG & add strings to STR#.

Change CNFG defaults:
	* In tempo/metronome marks, increase space between the tempo char. string and the
		note beginning the metronome mark from 0 eighth-spaces to 4
	* Increase "Additional top margin on 1st page" from 0 to 36 pts
	* Decrease "Min. space between lyrics" from 6 eighth-spaces to 4

Minor cleanup. Affects PitchCmds, ScoreInfo.

===============================================================================

21-25 Mar.

Update version number in About box to 5.6b5. Affects info.plist .

The default sizes of the three memory values in the CNFG were ridiculously low; increase
them by a factor of 10. (They're probably meaningless under any OS Ngale 5.x runs on,
but just in case.)

Fix bug: for tempo/metronome marks where tempo isn't given, the metronome mark is drawn
slightly to the right of where it should be. Affects DrawObject.

In feedback for dragging tempo/metronome marks, fix bug: the "expanded" attribute is
ignored; improve spacing between tempo and metronome mark (it still isn't quite
correct). Affects Dragging.

Rename the _string_ field of the Graphic object to _strOffset_. Affects NTypes.h; about
15 C files.

In the Context dialog, show the last previous Graphic for the staff, if there is one.
Affects Context.

Minor cleanup. Affects Dragging, Context, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

27 Mar.-9 Apr.

Rename the string and _metroStr_ fields of the Tempo object to _strOffset_ and
_metroStrOffset_. Rename _headerStr_ and _footerStr_ to  _headerStrOffset_ and
_footerStrOffset_. Affects FileConversion.h, NTypes.h, MemMacros.h; about 10 C files.

The Score Info dialog now reports how many out-of-range notes the score contains and
the measure no. of the first. Affects ScoreInfo; .rsrc: add strings to STR#.

Fix bug: In a C score ("Transpose MIDI" unchecked), some notes are incorrectly considered
out of range because we were assuming the notation was transposed. Affects ScoreInfo,
PitchCmds.

Make the default top of the cello, double bass and trumpet ranges less conservative; the
default bottom of the double bass range less conservative; and the default top of the
bassoon range _more_ conservative. Change the heading on the Instrument dialog from
"Transposition and Range" to "Transposition and Written Range". Affects .rsrc.

Minor cleanup. Affects About, DrawObject, Extract, ExtractHighLevel, HeaderFooterDialog,
InstrDialog, Menu, MIDIFSave, MIDIUtils, ScoreInfo.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11-13 Apr.

Get the string "selected parts" from a resource instead of compiling it in. Affects
.rsrc; ExtractHighLevel.

Move definition of FILENAME_MAXLEN to a header; use it in SaveNotelist() as well as
previous use. Affects NLimits.h; NotelistSave.

Move definitions of four limits from defs.h to NLimits.h.

Minor cleanup. Affects NLimits.h, Reconstruct.h; ExtractHighLevel, File, Menu,
MergeUtils, NotelistSave, Reconstruct, SelUtils.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14 Apr. - 5 May			       ==== NIGHTINGALE 5.6b5 ====

Get with 21st-century conventions by taking filename extensions seriously: put the
part name in default filenames of extracted parts before the dot instead of at the
very end. Affects NightTemplates.h; ExtractHighLevel, StringUtils.

Fix bug: For first measure with an out-of-range note, Score Info often gives the wrong
number. Affects ScoreInfo.

Reword a few of Score Info's messages. Affects .rsrc; ScoreInfo.

Replace corrupted (empty) Nightingale 2004 Help file with (what I think is) the correct
version.

Re-organize Tech Notes, and update the file NightingaleTechNotes.txt .

Replace the commercially-oriented header on ca. 160 files referring to Advanced Music
Notation Systems with a kinder, gentler one referring to Avian Music Notation
Foundation; change the splash screen to name Avian Music Notation Foundation instead of
Adept Music Notation Solutions.

Minor cleanup. Affects MemMacros.h; DebugHighLevel, DebugUtils, DrawNRGR, DrawObject,
Extract, File, MasterPage, StringUtils, and a few others.

===============================================================================

9 - 31 May

Update version number in About box to 5.6b6. Affects info.plist .

Show the measure's time (in ticks from the beginning of the score) in the Info dialog
for measures. Affects .rsrc; InfoDialog.

Pull a new header for notation style definitions, style.h, out of defs.h. Also affects
Nightingale_Prefix.pch.

Try to keep default filenames of extracted parts from exceeding the (Mac Classic)
length limit of 31 chars. Affects ExtractHighLevel.

Don't let the default respacing percent in the Extract Parts dialog exceed 100. Affects
ExtractHighLevel.

Increase default max. no. of documents (in the CNFG resource) from 20 to 30; this should
be helpful mostly to make extracting parts from a large score more convenient. Affects
.rsrc.

Have all XXXAdvise() and XXXInform() functions call LogPrintf(), so something (including
the alert ID but not the actual message) appears in the system log.

Move LogPrintf and related functions from Utility to UIFUtils.

Remove #ifdef'd-out code & comments re "Mackey's disease". Affects Event, File, Menu.

Minor cleanup. Affects CarbonPrinting, DialogsEditor, DrawNRGR, InfoDialog, Initialize,
MasterPage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2-9 June

Make error checking of CNFG values count just one error each for page margin and page
number margin, no matter how many of their fields are out of bounds. Affects Initialize.

Show page header and footer in the Browser window; make the window wider and taller to
accomodate them. Affects .rsrc; Browser.

When parts are extracted, they now inherit page headers and footers from the score.

Move DelAddRedAccs from CFilesBoth to CFilesEditor.

When a file is opened normally or read-only via menu command, or opened via Apple Event,
send a message saying so to the log file. Affects Event, Menu.

When extracting parts, if in a series of TEMPO objects there's more than one relevant to
a part, we assume they're identical (e.g., for an orchestra score where the tempo mark
appears above the top staff and somewhere in the middle), so we extract only the first
one. Affects Extract.

Rename screen font files so all have the extension .bmap .

Rename the TEMPO object _tempo_ field to _tempoMM_; rename the Config _defaultTempo_
to _defaultTempoMM_. Affects ApplicationTypes.h, NTypes.h; Browser, Check, File, FileInput,
Initialize, Insert, InsNew, MIDIFOpen, MIDIFSave, MIDIRecord, MIDIUtils, NotelistParse.

Add to tempo/metronome mark dialog an option to have no M.M., so it has no effect on
playback timing. Affects MemMacros.h; Browser, Check, DialogsEditor, Dragging,
DrawObject, InsNew, MIDIPlay, MIDIRecord, MIDIFSave, MIDIUtils, .rsrc.

Increase minimum legal tempo from 1 to 10 BPM. Affects DialogsEditor.

Minor cleanup. Affects Extract, ExtractHighLevel, HeaderFooterDialog, NTypes.h.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12-14 June

Make the Browser, Context, and Score Info windows wider. Affects .rsrc.

Change inconsistent definitions of min. tempo M.M. to MIN_BPM (currently 10); rename
MAXBPM to MAX_BPM. Affects NLimits.h; DialogsEditor, Initialize; .rsrc.

Minor cleanup. Affects DialogsEditor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16 June			       ==== NIGHTINGALE 5.6 (16 June 2016) ====

In the Info dialog for notes and rests, make the Dur field wider, to accomodate values
like "-47" for a 47-bar rest. Affects .rsrc.

Rename the "Transpose MIDI" command to "Transposed Score"; not only is the latter
standard terminology, but it's what the related alert calls the command. Affects .rsrc.

Make the "MIDI Dynamic Prefs" and "Instrument MIDI Settings" dialogs a little prettier.
Affects .rsrc.

===============================================================================

23-24 June

Change version number from 5.6 to 5.7b1. Affects Info.plist.

Fix bug: Paste Merge, Set Duration, and Remove Rhythmic Gaps/Resynchronize give a
strange error message for GRDraws (lines) anywhere in the score, e.g., =>
"FixGRDrawLinks: for 1155, firstObj=1157 or lastObj=1161 isn't a Sync or a GRSync.",
when lastObj is a Measure, which is actually legal. Affects Reconstruct.

Minor cleanup. Affects style.h, DebugUtils, Reconstruct.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

26-27 June

Fix problem with Xcode project: Xcode 2.5 (at least) can't save certain source-code
files -- Browser, DebugUtils, Dragging -- because it doesn't know what their
encoding is.

Now that the Browser window is slightly larger, have it show the first 25 voices of
