HOW TO QA SAMPLE SCORES - DAB, 1998; rev. April 2016

1. Open the file

2. Launch Console, and show system.log

3. Do Debug Check Standard (cmd-0, cmd-2) and look for anything nasty/surprising.

4. Play for a while (cmd-1): click to stop. NB: BachEbSonata plays each
	instrument on a different channel; the other standard Ngale 3.5 demo
	scores all play on one channel.

5. Print at least a page or two via Save PostScript > PostScript Text for Entire File

6. Select All (cmd-A) or some, and give any command in the Notes/Rests menu.

7. Close the file; if Ngale asks if you want to save changes, click _Don't Save_.
