Making Nightingale EPS Files Work with GhostView
Anonymous, Oct. 2000; revised by Don Byrd, Jan. 2001

(This should be cleaned up and combined with Nightingale Technical Note #7 to make
a more general document about printing high-quality music samples with apps other
than Nightingale.)

It's relatively easy to hack Nightingale-created EPS or PostScript files to work
with MacGS (GhostView for Macintosh) or GhostView for Windows; this should also work
with GhostView for Unix but we haven't tested it. (In principle it shouldn't need
any hacking; you should be able to simply use Apple's Print Manager to create .ps or
.eps files with the "include all but the standard 13" fonts option, but for some
reason GhostView doesn't like them - this may be because I am using my own hacked
TrueType version of Sonata - hmmm.)

A. The more complex but guaranteed-legal way:

1. Create an EPS or PostScript file in the normal way, using Nightingale's built-in
'Save as PostScript' command. (We'll call this file 'file.EPSF'.)

2. In addition, print the page to a PostScript file using the Print Manager. This
time don't use Nightingale's 'Save as PostScript' command, but the "Print ..."
command. Somewhere in the print dialog (depending on the Mac OS version) there is a
print-to-file option; choose the option "include all but the standard 13 fonts":
this will copy the PostScript Sonata font - which you must have installed on the
Mac, of course! - into this file. NOTE: this doesn't work on all systems: for
unknown reasons, on Don's PowerBook running OS 8.6, it fails. We'll call this file
'fileApple.PS'.

3. Open 'fileApple.PS' as _text_ in a text editor (BBEdit is recommended, as usual),
and copy the definition of Sonata, all lines from "%%BeginFont" to "%%EndFont".
Paste this into your original 'file.EPSF' immediately after the %%EndComments line
and save 'file.EPSF'.

4. GhostView will then read/display 'file.EPSF' with no problem. (I'm fairly sure
Word will display/print it too.)


B. The simpler way (NB: illegal unless you own the PostScript version of Sonata):

1. As above.

2. Paste the text file SonataPS.txt (the Sonata PostScript font) into 'file.EPSF'
immediately after the %%EndComments line, and save 'file.EPSF'.

3. GhostView will then read/display 'file.EPSF' with no problem. (I'm fairly sure
Word will display/print it too.)


CAVEAT! You'd think that you could Insert an EPSF created with the above method to
a Word document and display that document in GhostView, and see Sonata displayed
correctly. Nope: in that situation, GhostView uses Courier for music characters
_unless_ you first display an EPSF containing music!
