NIGHTINGALE DEBUGGING COMMANDS & OUTPUT - notes by DAB

(Nov. 2009)

Nightingale X no longer uses the Consolation window; instead, output from DebugPrintf
(including the Debug command) can be viewed with the Console utility, "under console
messages in log database queries" ?? -- actually in system.log . To see only
Nightingale DebugPrintf output, filter on "com.amns".

Caveat: (1) On Leopard (OS 10.5), console output is not flushed until Nightingale
quits -- pretty clumsy. (2) If Console is already running and displaying system.log,
you won't see the Ngale output until you Reload. ???MORE ACCURATE:
you may not see the Ngale output immediately! On my Intel MacBook, it didn't show
up for another 15 sec.; Reload doesn't seem to help.

In Console, on my MacBook (Snow Leopard), messsages from Ngale may show up with Sender =
(1) edu.indiana.Nightingale ("AudioUnitGraph" info);
(2) com.amns.nightingale (DebugPrintf, "pL=bleh rect.l=blah... paper.l=bluh...", etc.);
or, at least once, (3) just Nightingale!

Geoff sez, if you do ??, something gets written to stderr, which by default goes to
terminal window.

On my MacBook, I can't see DebugPrintf output in Console at all. ?!?

On my MacBook, I still can't see DebugPrintf output in Console at all, no matter what
I do. Could it be the version of Ngale I'm running?!? In any case, at this point,
Ngale should probably just write Debug messages to stderr!

In Debug.h:

	#define DebugPrintf printf

Ngale 5.5 and later calls LogPrintf() instead of DebugPrintf(). Output from it
(including the Debug command) can be viewed with the Console utility, in system.log .
To see only Nightingale output, filter on "com.amns".

According to Charlie (Mar. '07), hidden debugging commands in Ngale X. (Of course this
is irrelevant for beta versions, since they have the Test menu.)
