IDEAS FOR A NEW NIGHTINGALE FILE FORMAT - DAB, mid January 2018

ANOTE:
	* 1-2 more bits for accidental offset
	* 2 more bits for microtone
	* 2 bits for harmonics: values = normal note (non-harmonic), touched,
		stopped, sounding; touched & stopped normally play at velocity 0
	* Add bit to say if cue note (=> small, always play at cue velocity, etc.)
	* Consolidate fragmented fields
	* Add voice role, w/ same values as in VOICEINFO (VCROLE_UPPER, etc., incl.
		unknown)
	* Add 4-byte field for ID that can be referenced externally
	* Add 4 bytes for future use, initialized to 0
	* Expand ANOTE to >=38 bytes

DYNAMIC:
	* Add modifier bits (e.g., for "mpp", adding "subito", "piu")
	* Add "cross staff" bits: 1 to mean also affects staff below, 1 to say
		show curly brace or not
	
CLEF:
	* Change codes to leave space for more 8ve-transposing clefs, e.g.,
		SOPRANO8B and/or TENOR8B for basses

* Replace all short (2 bytes, mostly DDIST) coords. with long (4 bytes)
* Add >=2 bytes for future expansion to everything
* Remove FreeMIDI and OMS support fields: in PARTINFO, Document; elsewhere?
* Initialize all unused fields for everything
