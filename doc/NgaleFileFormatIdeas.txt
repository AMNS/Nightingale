IDEAS FOR A NEW NIGHTINGALE FILE FORMAT (AND OBJECT LIST) - DAB, mid April 2018 

The current format is 'N105", so the new one will be 'N106'.

NB: On top of the below ideas, it really looks as though making files readable by
Intel processors as well as Motorola/IBM (G5's etc.) will be a nightmare unless
we get rid of bit fields! Well, possibly bit fields of < 8 bits -- the vast majority
-- won't be too bad.  Cf. NgaleDevelopmentLog.txt .

ANOTE:
	* 1-2 more bits for accidental offset
	* 2 more bits for microtone
	* 2 bits for harmonics: values = normal note (non-harmonic), touched,
		stopped, sounding; touched & stopped normally play at velocity 0
	* Add bit to say if cue note (=> small, always play at cue velocity, etc.)
	* Consolidate fragmented fields
	* Add voice role, w/ same values as in VOICEINFO (VCROLE_UPPER, etc., incl.
		unknown)
	* Add 4-byte field for ID that can be referenced externally
	* Add 4 bytes for future use, initialized to 0

DYNAMIC:
	* Add modifier field(s) (e.g., for "mpp", adding "subito", "piu")
	* Add "cross staff" fields: one to say also affects staff below, staff above,
		or neither; one to say "show curly brace"

CLEF:
	* Change codes to leave space for more 8ve-transposing clefs, e.g.,
		SOPRANO8B and/or TENOR8B for basses

* Rearrange header fields so they're in a sensible order, w/ closely-related
	things close together (e.g., dIndentFirst and dIndentOther in Score header)
* Replace all short (2 bytes, mostly DDIST) coords. with long (4 bytes)
* Add >=2 bytes for future expansion to every object and subobject
* Remove FreeMIDI and OMS support fields: in PARTINFO, Document; elsewhere?
* Initialize all unused fields for everything (to 0 unless there's a very
	good reason to use something else!)
