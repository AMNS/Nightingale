NIGHTINGALE TECH NOTES - DAB, February 2013

NB: These need a lot of work. At least one (#5) is probably completely obsolete; one
(#2) is the Coding Guidelines, which are now in the AMNS/Nightingale GitHub repository
in a more up-to-date form; one (NgaleEPSToGhostView) wants to be merged into #7; etc.
And very few are really up-to-date.
