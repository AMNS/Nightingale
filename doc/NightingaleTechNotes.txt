NIGHTINGALE TECH NOTES - Don Byrd, rev. mid March 2016

NB: These need a lot of work. At least one (#5) is probably completely obsolete; one
(#2), the Coding Guidelines, is now in the AMNS/Nightingale GitHub repository in a
more up-to-date form; one (NgaleEPSToGhostView) wants to be merged into #7; etc. And
very few are really up-to-date.
