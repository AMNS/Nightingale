Nightingale Conventions for Modifier KeysNightingale Technical Note #9Don Byrd, December 1999These are the conventions, but there are, regrettably, many exceptions, especiallyin debug (including Browser) code.Caps lock	Use ONLY in non-public versions! With Option key, display debug info			(normally in the Consolation window, but when PostScript printing, on			the printed page); alone or in other combinations, all bets are off.Command		Standard Mac OS usage, for menu command shortcuts; also used for			shortcuts to dialog items.Control		Skip checks to disallow situations where Ngale may have problems: e.g.,			when inserting notes or dragging them vertically, skip checking for and			hence allow unisons.Option		Rarely used alone outside debug code. In flow-in text, repeat the last			word.Shift		In public versions, constrain: e.g., in dragging, to horizontal or			vertical motion only. This is pretty much standard Mac OS usage.
