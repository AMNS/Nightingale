NIGHTINGALE CONVENTIONS FOR MODIFIER KEYS
Nightingale Technical Note #9
Don Byrd, December 1999; rev. early January 2018

These key combinations are used in consistent ways:

Shift-control
			Display additional information (mostly for debugging) in the system log
			file (accessible via the Console utility).

Caps lock-option
			Display debug info: usually in the log file, but when PostScript printing,
			on the printed page.

And here are the conventions for keys used alone, but, regrettably, there are many
exceptions, especially in debug (including Browser) code.

Caps lock	Use sparingly, and NEVER in public versions! Often for break into the
			old low-level debugger; otherwise all bets are off.

Command		Standard Mac OS usage, for menu command shortcuts; also used for shortcuts
			to dialog items.

Control		Skip checks to disallow situations where Ngale may have problems: e.g.,
			when inserting notes or dragging them vertically, skip checking for and
			hence allow unisons.

Option		Not often used alone outside debug code. In flow-in text, repeat the last
			word; in editing slurs, move the other endpoint or control point
			symmetrically.

Shift		Constrain: e.g., in dragging, to horizontal or vertical motion only. This
			is pretty much standard Mac OS usage.
