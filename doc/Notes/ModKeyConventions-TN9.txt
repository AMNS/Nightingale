NIGHTINGALE CONVENTIONS FOR MODIFIER KEYS
Nightingale Technical Note #9
Don Byrd, December 1999; rev. early April 2021

These key combinations are used in a consistent way:

Shift-control [#define DETAIL_SHOW]
			Display additional information, mostly for debugging, and normally in the
			system log file (accessible via the Console utility), but for PostScript
			printing, on the printed page.

Shift-control-option [#define MORE_DETAIL_SHOW]
			Display further information, mostly for debugging, in the system log file
			(accessible via the Console utility).

These are the conventions for keys used alone; but there are many exceptions,
especially in debug code.

Caps lock	Use sparingly, and NEVER in public versions! Often for break into the
			old low-level debugger; otherwise all bets are off.

Command		Standard Mac OS usage, for menu command shortcuts; also used for shortcuts
			to dialog items.

Control		Skip checks to disallow situations where Ngale may have problems: e.g.,
			when inserting notes or dragging them vertically, skip checking for and
			hence allow unisons.

Option		Not often used alone outside debug code. In flow-in text, repeat the last
			word; in editing slurs, move the other endpoint or control point
			symmetrically. When invoking Browser, browse Master Page object list;
			within Browser, jump to the first or last object of the type
			(middle left and right buttons) or subobject of the object (up and down
			buttons).

Shift		When invoking Browser, browse Undo object list; within Browser, select
			only current subobject, if there is one. Elsewhere, constrain: e.g., in
			dragging, to horizontal or vertical motion only. (This is pretty much
			standard Mac OS usage.)
