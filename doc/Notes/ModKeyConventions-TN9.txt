NIGHTINGALE CONVENTIONS FOR MODIFIER KEYS
Nightingale Technical Note #9
Don Byrd, December 1999; rev. mid May 2020

This key combination is used in a consistent way:

Shift-control
			Display additional information, mostly for debugging, and normally in the
			system log file (accessible via the Console utility), but for PostScript
			printing, on the printed page.

Here are the conventions for keys used alone, but there are many exceptions, especially
in debug code.

Caps lock	Use sparingly, and NEVER in public versions! Often for break into the
			old low-level debugger; otherwise all bets are off.

Command		Standard Mac OS usage, for menu command shortcuts; also used for shortcuts
			to dialog items.

Control		Skip checks to disallow situations where Ngale may have problems: e.g.,
			when inserting notes or dragging them vertically, skip checking for and
			hence allow unisons.

Option		Not often used alone outside debug code. In flow-in text, repeat the last
			word; in editing slurs, move the other endpoint or control point
			symmetrically. In Browser, jump to the first or last object of the type
			(middle left and right buttons) or subobject of the object (up and down
			buttons).

Shift		In Browser, select only current subobject, if there is one. Elsewhere,
			constrain: e.g., in dragging, to horizontal or vertical motion only. (This
			is pretty much standard Mac OS usage.)
