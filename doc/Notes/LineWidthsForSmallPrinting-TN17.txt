LINEWIDTHS FOR PRINTING AND DISPLAY IN SMALL SIZES
DAB, mid March 2016

Nightingale's standard (default) PostScript printing line widths are too thin to reproduce well when the page is reproduced in a very small size -- for example, to fit in one column of a two-column page on letter-size or A4 paper, where a page is reduced in width to about 3 inches. These line widths can be set via the Engraver Prefs dialog. The defaults and reasonable values for a 3-inch wide page are:

				Default	For small
----------------------------------
Stems			8		12
Barlines		10		15
Ledger lines	13		20
Staff lines		8		12		
Slurs/ties		30		40

A number of other PostScript printing line widths may need adjusting, but can be
only by editing the "Nightingale AMNF Prefs" file, not with the Engraver Prefs dialog.
