Nightingale Technical Note #6, November 1998
Don Byrd

To get rid of an extra system at the beginning of a score:

1. Make sure the extra system (system 1) is completely empty.
2. Make sure system 2 isn't right-justified, e.g., by Respace command, if needed.
3. Reformat systems 1-2 with all default settings except for the appropriate extra
	margin (ignore any warning about hidden staves).
4. The first measure should be empty, so get rid of it by deleting the barline
	ending it.
5. If desired, Justify system 1.
6. Fix title, headings, copyright notice, etc.
