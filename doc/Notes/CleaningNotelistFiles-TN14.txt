Cleaning Up Notelist files in Nightingale
Donald Byrd, October 2002

The following procedure is very rough: there's too much variation from
situation to situation for it to be otherwise. You may want to Save at
almost any step, just in case. NB: in many ways this is similar to the
procedure for cleaning up imported MIDI files (Nightingale Tech Note
#10).

		notated as F-natural) otherwise correct as needed.
	- Select All; Delete Redundant Accs.
