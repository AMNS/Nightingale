STATUS OF NEW NIGHTINGALE FILE FORMAT (AND OBJECT LIST) - DAB, rev. early April 2022

The current format is 'N105", so the new one (starting with Ngale 6.0) is 'N106'.

General:
	- Consolidate fragmented fields, if there are any!
	+ Get rid of bitfields. They aren't compatible between Intel and PowerPC CPUs, and
		making files readable by both will be a nightmare unless we get rid of them!
		Cf. NgaleDevelopmentLog.txt .

TIME SIGNATURE:

	- Add field(s) to support additive meters, e.g., (4+2+3)/8; probably up to 4
		numerators. Maybe replace "SignedByte numerator" with "SignedByte numerator[4]"?

PARTINFO:
	- Remove FreeMIDI support fields, or just rename as "unused" or some such

ANOTE:
	- Increase resolution of xmovedots from quarter-spaces to (probably) eighth-spaces
		=> change default & range checks
	- Increase resolution of xmoveAcc from quarter-spaces to (probably) eighth-spaces
		=> change default & range checks
	- Add voice role, w/ same values as in VOICEINFO (VCROLE_UPPER, etc., incl.
		unknown)
	- Replace HALFNOTE_SHAPE w/ more general "duration multipler" (e.g., to draw 16th
		notes as 8ths for Chopin F-minor Ballade, m. 175)?
	+ >=2 more bits each for accidental H offset & aug. dot H offset
		xmoveAcc: goes from 5 to 8 bits; xmovedots: goes from 3 to 8 bits
	+ >=2 more bits for microtone (pitch offset, GP (& L?) domains)
		micropitch: 2 => 8 bits
	+ Add 4 bytes for future use, initialized to 0
	+ >=2 bits for artificial harmonics: values = normal note (non-harmonic), touched,
		stopped, sounding; touched & stopped normally play at velocity 0
	+ Add 2- or 4-byte field for ID that can be referenced externally
	+ Add space for >=4 segments of notehead graphs

DYNAMIC:
	+ Add modifier field(s) (e.g., for "mpp", adding "subito", "piu"/"meno", etc.)
	+ Add "cross staff" field(s): to say also affects staff below, staff above, or
		neither; also say "show curly brace if cross-staff"

CLEF:
	?- Change codes to leave space for more 8ve-transposing clefs, e.g., SOPRANO8B
		and/or TENOR8B for bass voice? Allow for every half space from bass-8va
		bassa (conventional double bass) to treble-8va alta: 28(?) values?

Miscellaneous:
- Rearrange header fields so they're in a sensible order, w/ closely-related things
	close together (e.g., dIndentFirst and dIndentOther in Score header)
- Replace short (2 bytes, mostly DDIST) x coords. with long (4 bytes) where more range
	might be useful. While I'm at it, good to also change them to, say, units of
	DDIST/10 to increase precision. By far the most important is object xd; see Issue
	#197.
- Add >=2 bytes for future expansion to every object and subobject
- Remove support fields for obsolete MIDI drivers (mostly FreeMIDI & OMS), or just
	rename as "unused" or some such: in Document; elsewhere? Also remove #defines for
	them
- Initialize all unused fields for everything (to 0 unless there's a very good reason
	to use something else!). Simplest way: FillMem() on whole struct.

Note: The order of CONFIG fields is ridiculous and confusing, but that's a completely
separate issue from the music file format! It affects only the "Nightingale Prefs"
file.
